# ABAP 4 Editor Themes Collection

If you're using SAPgui's *already-not-so-*new ABAP editor, you can have your own theme. Here's mine:

In this repo, you can find this and other themes as well.

# Motivation

Programmers are adopting simple code editors with dark themes and custom color schemes accross different platforms and programming languages. This makes code easier to read and also gives our eyes a break from that white background.

Alexey Arseniev, suggested that we created a central repo in which people can find themes and also contribute with their own versions of them.

# Contribute with your own theme

The themes are organized under the [themes](themes/) folder. If you want to contribute, please add your own theme folder under this one. Remember also to include a theme-info.md with your theme information and a nice screenshot so that other people can see it before downloading it.

# Thanks

Thank you Custodio de Oliveira, for adopting, customizing and sharing a version of the theme. Thank you Alexey Arseniev for all the work you did on AB4 editor.
